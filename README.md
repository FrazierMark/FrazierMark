Hi there! My name is Mark, and I'm a software developer living in Berkeley, CA.

Throughout my early career, I've had the opportunity to work in the film industry where I've honed my skills as a fixer, learner, and creator. I'm excited to bring my software engineering skills and my creative background together as I continue to explore the intersection of creativity and technology.
